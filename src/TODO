Keep movement classic where the snake jumps to the next position at a specific
interval (speed) internally.

The drawing of the snake should be interpolated so that the animation to the
next position is smooth.

Could be something to do a tech demo on: interpolation.

The lerping animation is implemented but it is flawed! It needs to lag behind
the actual move. Once the move to the next location is completed the animation
towards THAT final destination should begin

Currently the lerping animation is "ahead" of the actual current location
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE - The lerping animation happens on the tail segment of the snake
giving the illusion of the snake coiling up before lurching to the next
position



FEATURE: Input Buffer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The input buffer is already being implemented. There are just a few kinks to
workout. I am not confident on the last in first out implementation of the
stack, I want the latest input to take precendence ONLY if there hasn't been
any input during a specified amount of time. This is the latest feature that I
still haven't implemented. The idea of a time to live for the buffer, where the
time between keystrokes is observed and if the time between keystrokes exceed a
arbitrary (read tunable) time the buffer will be cleared out to allow for the
new input to be recorded.

		I need to review the stack and order in which inputs are added and
		consumed. TTL of the buffer hasn't been implemented yet.

Example text display is complete. I will work on a wrapper class that can
instantiate a new text surface using an already initialzed font. This new class
will provide methods to handle multiline text. It will store text in an list of
strings and will keep track of any changes for a new render on the update call.
Draw logic will be handled internally.
