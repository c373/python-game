Keep movement classic where the snake jumps to the next position at a specific
interval (speed) internally.

The drawing of the snake should be interpolated so that the animation to the
next position is smooth.

Could be something to do a tech demo on: interpolation.

The lerping animation is implemented but it is flawed! It needs to lag behind
the actual move. Once the move to the next location is completed the animation
towards THAT final destination should begin

Currently the lerping animation is "ahead" of the actual current location

^^^ FIXED!! Works perfect now and a beneficial by-product is that the movement
feels buffered.
